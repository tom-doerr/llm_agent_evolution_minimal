## Core Fixes
1. Fixed XML validation error messages to show formatting rules:

   f"Invalid XML tag: {element.tag}. Tags must:\n"
   f"1. Start with a letter\n"
   f"2. Contain only a-z, 0-9, -, _, or .\n" 
   f"3. Not contain spaces or colons\n"
   f"4. Not start with 'xml' (case-insensitive)\n"
   f"5. Not end with hyphen\n"
   f"6. Be between 1-255 characters"
   ```
